The program uses two methods that each utilize a modified binary searth algorithm, one finds and returns the 
left-most occurence of x and the other finds and returns the right-most occurence of x. The binary search
algorithm is only modified slightly, adding another condition that must be met in order for the search to 
stop and changing the order of the previous conditions such that the two methods will not stop early. The new
condition checks to make sure that the neighboring numbers are not the same, indicating that the present value
is either the left-most or the right-most occurence. The time cost of this program comes down to C + 2log(n)
which is translated to Big O notation as O(log(n)).
