The singularly linked list implements a stack structure such that the head node acts as the top of the stack. 
The tester class fills an array list (out of convienience) with every line in the text file and sends it to
a method that calculates the postfix expression in the array list. It does so by looking at each entry in 
the list and either pushing it to a linked list stack if it is a number or popping out the last two entries
in the stack and performing the intended operation if the next entry in the list is an operator. When this
finishes, the only item in the stack is the solution to the postfix expression and that is then displayed on
the screen.
